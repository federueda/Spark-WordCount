# Apache Spark - WordCount

A5 SPARK EXERCISE

Load the complete Shakespeare writings, strip the header and search for the #24 most used word in his writings. 

Additionally, do the following:

- What is the resulting word?
- What installation did you worked with? Where there any obstacles?

Reference to Shakespeareâ€™s work: https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt

## 1st Step: Install Java using Brew

$ brew cask install java

## 2nd Step: Install Scala using Brew

$ brew install scala

## 3rd Step: Install Apache Spark using Brew

brew install apache-spark

## 4th Step: Install PySpark

$ pip3 install pyspark

## 5th Step: Define environmental variables/paths in .bash_profile for Java, Spark and PySpark

$ sudo nano .bash_profile

## 6th Step: use pyspark to code word count functionality using Spark

The first thing is to create a context with necessary configuration, then read text from file and split each line into words, and count by words. Finally, get the dictionary sorted from high to low counts and select position 25th (the first one is blank space).
